      Enable the FTEST framework. This framework is used to test scenarios where
      several entities are involved, like network communication or complex
      interactions.

    help
      The maximum number of entities that can be handled by the FTEST sheduler.
      This value should be set based on the expected number of entities in your tests.
      Increasing this value allows for more entities to be managed simultaneously,
      but may require more memory.
